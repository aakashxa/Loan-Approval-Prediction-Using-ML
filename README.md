# Loan-Approval-Prediction-Using-ML

## Project Objective

The objective of this project is to build a model that will predict whether an individual who has applied for a loan would get the aprroval or not using Machine Learning Algorithms.

It will be based upon the user's martial status, dependents, education level, employment status, etc.

## Dataset Features

Dataset Source: https://www.kaggle.com/altruistdelhite04/loan-prediction-problem-dataset

The following dataset features are same in both Train and Test datasets expect for the 'Loan_Status' column in the Test dataset which we will predict in this project.

1. Loan_ID : Unique Loan ID
2. Gender : Male/ Female
3. Married Applicant : Married (Y/N)
4. Dependents : Number of Dependents
5. Education Applicant Education : (Graduate/Not Graduate)
6. Self_Employed : Self Employed (Y/N)
7. ApplicantIncome : Applicant Income
8. CoapplicantIncome : Coapplicant Income
9. LoanAmount : Loan Amount in Thousands
10. Loan_Amount_Term : Term of Loan in Months
11. Credit_History : Credit History meets guidelines
12. Property_Area : Urban/Semi-Urban/Rural
13. Loan_Status : Loan Approved (Y/N)

## Steps Involved in the Project

1. Importing the required libraries.
2. Acquiring the dataset, visualizing it and cleaning the data set.
3. Exploratory Data Analysis

  (i) Univariate Data Analysis and the resulting observations are noted.
  
  (ii) Bivariate Data Analysis and the resulting observations are noted.
4. Data Pre-processing
5. Model Building

  (i) Logistic Regression
  
  (ii) Support Vector Machine
  
  (iii) Decision Tree
  
  (iv) Random Forest
  
  (v) K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
6. Choosing a model with highest accuracy.
